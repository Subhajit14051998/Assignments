    "send and receive data between a client (such as a web browser) and a\n",
    "server.\n",

    "It retrieves data from the server and includes the data in the URL as\n",

    "HTTP parameters, form data, JSON, files, etc. The request object\n",

    "3\\. The redirect() function in Flask is used to redirect the client's\n",
    "web browser to a different location. It sends a response to the client\n",
