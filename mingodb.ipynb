    "1\\. MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database management system\n",
    "that uses a document-oriented model to store and retrieve data. It is\n",
    "designed to be flexible, scalable, and high-performing. MongoDB stores\n",
    "data in a JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for\n",
    "easy representation and manipulation of complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, including MongoDB, are designed to handle\n",
    "unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional SQL databases.\n",
    "They can store data in various formats. This large amounts of data need\n",
    "to be processed quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in several scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "a\\) Flexible data models: When dealing with constantly evolving or\n",
    "unstructured data, MongoDB's document model allows for easy schema\n",
    "changes without affecting existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "b\\) Scalability: MongoDB's distributed architecture enables horizontal\n",
    "scaling by adding more servers, which can handle high volumes of read\n",
    "and write operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "c\\) High performance: MongoDB's ability to store related data within a\n",
    "single document eliminates the need for complex joins and enables faster\n",
    "queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "d)Real-time analytics: MongoDB's ability to handle large volumes of data\n",
    "and provide real-time analytics makes it suitable for applications like\n",
    "IoT, social media, and log data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "e\\) Agile development: MongoDB's flexible data model and support for\n",
    "dynamic queries make it suitable for agile development environments\n",
    "where rapid iterations and changes are common.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "a\\) Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like\n",
    "documents called BSON, allowing for easy representation and manipulation\n",
    "of complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "b\\) Scalability: It supports horizontal scaling by distributing data\n",
    "across multiple servers, providing high availability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "c\\) Indexing: MongoDB supports various types of indexes, including\n",
    "single-field, compound, geospatial, and text indexes, to optimize query\n",
    "performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "d\\) Ad hoc queries: MongoDB supports dynamic queries, allowing users to\n",
    "query documents based on any field or combination of fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "e\\) Replication and high availability: It supports replica sets, which\n",
    "provide automatic failover and data redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "f\\) Aggregation framework: MongoDB's aggregation pipeline allows for\n",
    "complex data aggregation and transformation operations, such as\n",
    "grouping, filtering, and joining.\n",
    "\n",
    "g\\) Geospatial capabilities: MongoDB provides built-in geospatial\n",
    "indexes and queries, enabling location-based queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "h\\) Auto-sharding: MongoDB can automatically partition data across\n",
    "multiple shards, enabling horizontal scaling and efficient data\n",
    "distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "i\\) Full-text search: MongoDB offers full-text search capabilities,\n",
    "including text indexing and search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "j\\) Transactions:MongoDB supports multi-document ACID transactions,\n",
    "ensuring data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. This is an example code to connect MongoDB to Python, create a\n",
    "database, and a collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27015/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Create/connect to a database\n",
    "\n",
    "mydb = client\\[\"mydatabase\"\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Create/connect to a collection\n",
    "\n",
    "mycol = mydb\\[\"mycollection\"\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we establish a connection to MongoDB running on the\n",
    "local machine at the default port 27015. We create a database named\n",
    "\"mydatabase\" and a collection named \"mycollection\" within that database.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.This is an example code to insert one record and insert multiple\n",
    "records into a MongoDB collection, and then print the inserted record\n",
    "using the find() and find_one() methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27015/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Access the database and collection\n",
    "\n",
    "mydb = client\\[\"mydatabase\"\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "mycol = mydb\\[\"mycollection\"\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Insert one record\n",
    "\n",
    "record = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\n",
    "\n",
    "mycol.insert_one(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Inserted record ID:\", record\\[\"\\_id\"\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Insert multiple records\n",
    "\n",
    "records = \\[\n",
    "\n",
    "{\"name\": \"Ali\", \"age\": 25},\n",
    "\n",
    "{\"name\": \"Bali\", \"age\": 35},\n",
    "\n",
    "{\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 40}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "mycol.insert_many(records)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Inserted multiple records.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Print the inserted record using find_one()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"First inserted record:\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(mycol.find_one())\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Print all inserted records using find()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"All inserted records:\")\n",
    "\n",
    "for record in mycol.find():\n",
    "\n",
    "print(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, We insert one record using insert_one() and multiple\n",
    "records using insert_many(). The \\_id field of the inserted record is\n",
    "automatically generated by MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "To print the inserted record, we use find_one() to retrieve the first\n",
    "record matching the query (in this case, any record). For printing all\n",
    "inserted records, we use find() without any query parameters, which\n",
    "returns a cursor that we can iterate over to access each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. The find() method in MongoDB is used to query the database and\n",
    "retrieve documents that match certain criteria. It allows us to specify\n",
    "query conditions based on field values, perform range queries, use\n",
    "logical operators, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example code demonstrating the use of the find() method to\n",
    "query the MongoDB database:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Access the database and collection\n",
    "\n",
    "mydb = client\\[\"mydatabase\"\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "mycol = mydb\\[\"mycollection\"\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Find documents with age greater than 30\n",
    "\n",
    "query = {\"age\": {\"\\$gt\": 30}}\n",
    "\n",
    "result = mycol.find(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Print the matching documents\n",
    "\n",
    "for doc in result:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(doc)\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. The sort() method in MongoDB is used to sort the documents in a\n",
    "collection based on one or more fields. It allows us to specify the sort\n",
    "order as ascending (1) or descending (-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example to demonstrate sort() method in MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Access the database and collection\n",
    "\n",
    "mydb = client\\[\"mydatabase\"\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "mycol = mydb\\[\"mycollection\"\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Sort documents by age in descending order\n",
    "\n",
    "result = mycol.find().sort(\"age\", -1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Print the sorted documents\n",
    "\n",
    "for doc in result:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(doc)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this above example, the sort() method is called on the resulting\n",
    "cursor with the field \"age\" and the sort order -1 (descending). The\n",
    "returned cursor is then iterated to print the sorted documents based on\n",
    "age in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "7\\. a) The delete_one() method in MongoDB is used to delete a single\n",
    "document that matches a specified filter. It deletes the first document\n",
    "that matches the given filter criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of using delete_one():\n",
    "\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27015/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Access the database and collection\n",
    "\n",
    "mydb = client\\[\"mydatabase\"\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "mycol = mydb\\[\"mycollection\"\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Delete a document\n",
    "\n",
    "query = {\"name\": \"John\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "mycol.delete_one(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we establish a connection to MongoDB and access the\n",
    "desired database and collection. We define a query to specify the\n",
    "document to be deleted (in this case, a document with the name \"John\").\n",
    "The delete_one() method is called with the query, and it deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "b\\) The delete_many() method is used to delete multiple documents that\n",
    "match a specified filter. It deletes all the documents that match the\n",
    "given filter criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of using delete_many():\n",
    "\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27015/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Access the database and collection\n",
    "\n",
    "mydb = client\\[\"mydatabase\"\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "mycol = mydb\\[\"mycollection\"\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Delete multiple documents\n",
    "\n",
    "query = {\"age\": {\"\\$gt\": 30}}\n",
    "\n",
    "mycol.delete_many(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example,the delete_many() method is called with the query, and\n",
    "it deletes all the documents that match the query criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "c\\) The drop() method is used to drop an entire collection from a\n",
    "database. It permanently removes the collection and all its documents\n",
    "from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of using drop():\n",
    "\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27015/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Access the database\n",
    "\n",
    "mydb = client\\[\"mydatabase\"\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Drop a collection\n",
    "\n",
    "mydb\\[\"mycollection\"\\].drop()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example,the drop() method is called on the collection we want to\n",
    "drop (in this case, \"mycollection\"). It permanently removes the\n",
    "collection and all its documents from the database."
