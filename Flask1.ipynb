    "1\\. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is designed to\n",
    "be lightweight and simple, providing developers with the tools to build\n",
    "web applications quickly and efficiently. Flask follows the\n",
    "Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and is often used to\n",
    "create RESTful APIs or small to medium-sized web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "a\\) Lightweight and Easy to Use: Flask is a minimalistic framework that\n",
    "does not impose many restrictions on developers. It allows them to have\n",
    "more control over the structure and design of their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "b\\) Flexible and Modular: Flask provides a modular design, allowing\n",
    "developers to choose and add only the necessary components and\n",
    "extensions to their applications. It does not force any specific\n",
    "database or templating engine, giving developers the freedom to choose\n",
    "what works best for their project.\n",
    "\n",
    "c\\) Extensive Documentation: Flask has excellent documentation that is\n",
    "well-organized and easy to follow. The documentation covers various\n",
    "topics, including getting started, routing, templates, and database\n",
    "integration, making it easier for developers to learn and use Flask\n",
    "effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "d\\) Large and Active Community: Flask has a large and active community\n",
    "of developers who contribute to its growth. This means that there are\n",
    "plenty of resources available, including tutorials, examples, and\n",
    "extensions, which can help developers solve problems and enhance their\n",
    "applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "e\\) Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development\n",
    "server, which allows developers to quickly test and run their\n",
    "applications without the need for additional setup. This feature is\n",
    "particularly useful during the development and debugging stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Here's a simple Flask application that displays \"Hello World!!\":\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(\\_\\_name\\_\\_)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "\n",
    "return 'Hello World!!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if \\_\\_name\\_\\_ == '\\_\\_main\\_\\_':\n",
    "\n",
    "app.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. App routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to\n",
    "specific functions in a Flask application. It allows us to define\n",
    "different routes for different URLs and define the logic that should be\n",
    "executed when a user visits a specific URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use app routes in Flask to handle different types of requests (e.g.,\n",
    "GET, POST) and provide appropriate responses. By using routes, we can\n",
    "define different views or endpoints of your application and specify what\n",
    "should be rendered or returned to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "App routes are beneficial because they provide a clear and organized way\n",
    "to define the different functionalities of your web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Here's an example Flask application that includes a \"/welcome\" route\n",
    "and a \"/\" route to display specific details:\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(\\_\\_name\\_\\_)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/welcome')\n",
    "\n",
    "def welcome():\n",

    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "\n",

    "company_name = 'ABC Corporation'\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "app.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. The url_for() function in Flask is used for URL building. It\n",
    "generates a URL for a specified route function, taking into account the\n",
    "application's URL mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an example Python code to demonstrate the working of the url_for()\n",
    "function:\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(\\_\\_name\\_\\_)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/hello')\n",
    "\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "\n",
    "return 'Hello World!'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/user/\\<username\\>')\n",
    "\n",
    "def show_user_profile(username):\n",
    "\n",
    "return f'User: {username}'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/post/\\<int:post_id\\>')\n",
    "\n",
    "def show_post(post_id):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "if \\_\\_name\\_\\_ == '\\_\\_main\\_\\_':\n",
    "\n",
    "with app.test_request_context():\n",
    "\n",
    "print(url_for('hello')) \\# Output: /hello\n",
    "\n",
    "print(url_for('show_user_profile', username='John')) \\# Output:\n",
    "/user/John\n",
    "\n",
    "print(url_for('show_post', post_id=123)) \\# Output: /post/123\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define three routes: \"/hello\", \"/user/\\<username\\>\",\n",
    "and \"/post/int:post_id\". Inside the if \\_\\_name\\_\\_ == '\\_\\_main\\_\\_':\n",
    "block, we create a test request context to access the url_for()\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the above code will print the generated URLs for each route\n",
