    "5: A confidence interval is a range of values within which a population\n",
    "parameter, like a mean or proportion, is likely to fall with a certain\n",
    "level of confidence. To calculate a confidence interval, you use sample\n",
    "data and a margin of error. For instance, if you measured the heights of\n",
    "a sample of 100 people and calculated a mean height of 165 cm with a 95%\n",
    "confidence interval of ±3 cm, you can be 95% confident that the true\n",
